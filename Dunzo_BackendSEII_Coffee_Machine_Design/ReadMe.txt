-The code has been properly commented and readable.
-The test cases can be found here: Dunzo_BackendSEII_Coffee_Machine_Design/src/test/resources
-Mockito and JUnit is used for functional testing

-All the expected requirements have been taken care of while designing the Coffee-machine
	1. It will be serving some beverages.
	2. Each beverage will be made using some ingredients.
